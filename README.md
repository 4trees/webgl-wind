## WebGL Wind

A WebGL-powered visualization of wind power.
Capable of rendering up to 1 million wind-led particles at 60fps.

This project is heavily inspired by the work of
[Cameron Beccario](https://twitter.com/cambecc)
with his wonderful [Earth project](https://earth.nullschool.net/)
and its [open-source version](https://github.com/cambecc/earth),
and [Fernanda Vi√©gas and Martin Wattenberg](http://hint.fm/) with their
[US Wind Map project](http://hint.fm/projects/wind/).
